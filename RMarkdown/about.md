#### Calculating your GPA

Your **Grade Point Average** (GPA) is a number that indicates how well you have scored in your courses on average, and is calculated with the following formula:

$$GPA = \frac{Total~Grade~Points~Earned}{Total~Credits~Attempted}$$

To calculate the grade points you have earned in a course, each letter grade is assigned a grade point value (e.g., B = 3.0) which is then multiplied by the credit hours for that course. For example, if your final grade in ENGL 101 was a B and the course was worth 3 credit hours, you would earn 9 grade points for ENGL 101.

You can find the grade point values used in this app by clicking the **Show GPA Scale Legend** checkbox. If the default values are not suitable you can modify them by choosing the *Custom* option in the **Select GPA Scale** selector.

#### Using this application

The main function of this application is to calculate your overall GPA, but you can also use it to:

* Convert your GPA to different GPA Scales using the **Select GPA Scale** selector
* Calculate your GPA within a specific subject and/or time period using the **Filter** boxes
* Check how your GPA would change if you retook a course and earned a better grade

After clicking the **Calculate GPA** button you can also:

* Visually track your academic progress using the graphs in the **Output** tab
* Download a .csv file of the data you input using the **Download Data** button
